## Project Name: Gold vs USD & Time
## Overview:
Historically gold coinage was widely used as currency; when paper money was introduced, it typically was a receipt redeemable for gold coin or bullion. In a monetary system known as the gold standard, a certain weight of gold was given the name of a unit of currency.
In the 20th century, the use of the gold standard declined. The Great Depression and World War II led to the abandonment of the gold standard by many countries. The United States stopped using the gold standard in 1971. Today, most countries use fiat currency, which is not backed by a commodity such as gold. Instead, the value of fiat currency is determined by the monetary policies of governments and central banks. Today we have had several banking collapses and we want to take a look at what it would look like if we went back to a gold standard banking system to give our dollar value again.
##Description of Data:
The daily gold price historical data set available on Kaggle is a comprehensive collection of information about the price of gold over a period of time. The data set contains information about the price of gold from January 1985 to August 2021, a period spanning over 36 years. The data set has a total of 9 columns, which include the date, the opening price of gold, the closing price of gold, the highest price of gold for the day, the lowest price of gold for the day, the volume of gold traded, the change in price of gold during the day, the percentage change in price of gold during the day, and the absolute change in price of gold during the day. One usage scenario for this data is to conduct research on the trends in gold prices over the years. With this dataset, one can analyze the fluctuations in gold prices over a given period, identify trends, and predict future prices. This could be useful for investors who are looking to make informed decisions about buying or selling gold. Additionally, this data could be used to conduct research on factors that influence gold prices, such as economic indicators or geopolitical events.
